# afc-c README

AFC-c is a tool to help developers get terminal outputs on discord when they are afk.

## Features

This extension helps developers stay connected even when they're away from their keyboard (AFK). If you're AFK for a certain period and have joined the configured Discord server, it will automatically send a message via a Discord bot, notifying others of your status or predefined message.

üîë Key Features
‚è≥ AFK Detection: Detects when you're inactive in VS Code for a specified time.

ü§ñ Discord Integration: Automatically sends a message using a Discord bot when you're AFK.

üõ°Ô∏è Server-Specific: Only works if you‚Äôve joined the linked Discord server.

‚úçÔ∏è Customizable Messages: Set your own AFK timers, polling intervals and number of outputs to batch in the extension settings.

## Requirements

Join the `afc-c` server on Discord using this [invite link](https://discord.gg/BbpRnPVMeW) 
Turn on developer mode from settings of your profile
Copy user id from the server after turning on developer mode

and you're all set!

## Network Activity

This extension sends terminal output messages via POST request to a custom backend:
- Endpoint: `https://afc-cproxyserver-production.up.railway.app/send-dm`
- Purpose: To forward AFK terminal logs to Discord via bot DM
- No personal data or user identifiers are shared beyond the configured user ID


## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: Enable/disable this extension.
* `myExtension.thing`: Set to `blah` to do something.
